# RISC-V Assembler in C++

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a RISC-V Assembler that converts Assembly level instructions into machine code (binary 0s and 1s). The assembler supports the entire RISC-V instruction set and maps instructions to their corresponding machine code.

## Features
- **Full RISC-V Support**: The assembler covers all instruction types (R, I, S, U, J, B) as specified by the RISC-V ISA.
- **Binary Conversion**: Converts assembly instructions to binary machine code.
- **Instruction Mapping**: Instructions are mapped according to their types and corresponding machine-level representation.
- **Extensible Design**: The code structure allows easy addition or modification of RISC-V instructions.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nitin1942003/Risc-V-Assembler-C.git
